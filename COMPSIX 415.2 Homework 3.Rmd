## Section 3.8.1 Exercises (all)
##

#### *1. What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?*

The problem with the first plot is that there are too many overlapping points on the graph. Using the `geom_jitter` aesthetic allows for a more accurate illustration of the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Without jitter")
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("With jitter")
```


#### *2. What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?*

Using `height` and `width` will adjust the spread parameters. If not used, jitter will be set to 40% of the resolution.

```{r}
?geom_jitter
```

#### *3. Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count`.* 

The aesthetic `geom_jitter` gives a spread around the same observation while `geom_count` represents the overlapping values with area. A point that has at least 5 observations will have an area of 5 while a value that is observed at least 10 will have a corresponding area. 

```{r}
?geom_count
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("With jitter")
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
 geom_count() +
  ggtitle("With count")
```


#### *4. What's the default position for adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.*

By looking up the aesthetic via `?geom_boxplot`, under the "Computed variables" section, it shows that the lower whisker is negative 1.5 X the interquartile range; the lower hinge is at the 25% quantile; middle is the median; upper hinge is the 75% quantile; ymax is positive 1.5 X the interquartile range.

The boxplot below shows the highway mpg for cars based on their wheel drive. The front wheel drive cars show the greatest mpg efficiency while 4 wheel drive and rear wheel drive are similar with rear wheel drive being more efficient and with less variability in obversations compared to 4 wheel drive. 

```{r}
?geom_boxplot
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


## Section 3.9.1 (2 and 4)

#### *2. What does `labs()` do?*

`labs()` gives the user the ability to add titles, subtitles, and captions to plots. 

```{r}
?labs
```

#### *4. What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?*

Using the `geom_abline` as a reference where the slope is equal to 1, the plot shows that all cars have a higher mpg efficiency on the highway compared to the city (`geom_abline` creates a slope of the graph and include an x intercept). As cars become more efficient overall, their efficiency is increased on the highway as well. In other words, cars that are efficient overall do even better on the highway. `coord_fixed() is important because it creates a one-to-one proportionality between the scale on the x and y axis. This is important in this graph because the unit of measure, miles, should be seen as equal on both scales. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() + 
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  ggtitle("With coord_fixed")

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() + 
  ggtitle("Without coord_fixed")
  
?coord_fixed
?geom_abline
```


## Section 4.4 (1 and 2)

#### *1. Why does this code not work?*

`
my_variable <- 10  
(my_varÄ±able)  
`

The code above does not work because we are calling a non-existent value because `my_varlable` with an l has not been defined. Only `my_variable` with an i has. 

#### *2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

To run the code correctly, I had to correct `fliter` to `filter`, set a `==` to 8 as a singular `=` isn't recognized by R. The diamond data was also removed as we were using the mpg data set and not the diamond data set. 

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
