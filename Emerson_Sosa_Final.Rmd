# Exercise 1 - Sampling Distributions, Functions and For Loops

### Step 1 

Write an R function that does the following:

  - Takes a sample of size samp_size from this exponential distribution (samp_size is an        input parameter for the function)
  - Calculates the mean of that sample
  - Calculates the standard deviation of that sample
  - Returns the calculated mean and standard deviation as a list

```{r}

# sample size
samp_size <- 100

# set the rate parameter
samp_rate <- 1/10000

# take sample
samp.output <- rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)


samp_fun <- function(samp_size, samp_rate) {
  samp_avg <- mean(samp.output)
  samp_std_dev <- sd(samp.output)
  stats <- list(samp_avg = samp_avg, samp_std_dev = samp_std_dev)
  return(stats)
}

samp_fun(100000)
```

### Step 2

Then write a loop that does this:

  - Runs the above function 1000 times, with samp_size = 50 and samp_rate = 1/10000
  - Saves all of the sample means in a vector called sample_means, and all of the sample        standard deviations in a vector called sample_sds

```{r}

# sample size
samp_size <- 50

# set the rate parameter
samp_rate <- 1/10000

# take sample
samp.output <- rexp(n = samp_size, rate = samp_rate)


samp_fun <- function(samp_size, samp_rate) {
  samp_avg <- mean(samp.output)
  samp_std_dev <- sd(samp.output)
  stats <- list(samp_avg = samp_avg, samp_std_dev = samp_std_dev)
  return(stats)
}

#my_mods <- my_samps <- list() # empty lists for saving models and samples
#for(i in 1:n) {

# create space for the output of your loop 
n <- 10
sample_means <- rep(NA, n)
sample_sds <- rep(NA, n)

# start the loop
for(i in 1:n) {
  sample_means[i] <- i
}
#  ...
 # output_vector[index] <- output # save the output for each iteration
#}
```


# Exercise 2 - Linear Regression

Load the train.csv dataset into R and fit a regression model with:

  - y = SalePrice
  - Features: LotArea, OverallQual, and ExterQual
  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(broom)
train.data <- 
  read_csv('train.csv')

#Analyzing regression model for SalePrice, LotArea, OverallQual, ExerQual.
house.mult.lm <- lm(SalePrice ~ LotArea + OverallQual + ExterQual, data = train.data)

tidy(house.mult.lm)
glance(house.mult.lm)


ggplot(train.data) +
  geom_point(aes(ExterQual, SalePrice))

#Analyzing regression model from Homework 7.
train.mult.lm <- lm(formula = SalePrice ~ OverallQual + GrLivArea + Neighborhood, data = train.data)

tidy(train.mult.lm)
glance(train.mult.lm)
```

<font color=#F38812 size=4>Use the broom package to output the coefficients and the R-squared</font>

Coefficients and R-Squared are in the outputted tibbles above. 

<font color=#F38812 size=4> Interpret the coefficient on LotArea</font>

The coefficient for LotArea is 1.452925. In other words, for every one unit increase in lot size in square feet, the price increases, on average, by $1.45. 

<font color=#F38812 size=4>Interpret the coefficient on ExterQualGd
 </font>
 
The coefficient for ExterQualGd is -71529.49. In other words, for every one unit increase in the external quality being graded as 'Good', the price decreases, on average, by $71,529. This makes sense as the reference point is external quality being Excellent. Anything under would decrease in price.  

<font color=#F38812 size=4>Compare this model to the model we fit in HW 7 with GrLivArea, OverallQual, Neighborhood. Which is the better fitting model?
 </font>
 
 Using R squared as our rationale for deciding which is the better fit, HW 7's R adjusted squared (used when there are more than one variable) is *0.782981* and the model asked to be analyzed in this homework assignment is *0.693963*. As theorized in class, an R Squared value that is closer to one is a better fit so it would seem that the model used in HW 7 is better than the one built in this assignment.
