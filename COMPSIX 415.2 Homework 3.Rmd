#### *1. What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?*

The problem with the first plot is that there are too many overlapping points on the graph. Using the `geom_jitter` aesthetic allows for a more accurate illustration of the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Without jitter")
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("With jitter")
```


#### *2. What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?*

Using `height` and `width` will adjust the spread parameters. If not used, jitter will be set to 40% of the resolution.

```{r}
?geom_jitter
```

#### *3. Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count`.* 

The aesthetic `geom_jitter` gives a spread around the same observation while `geom_count` represents the overlapping values with area. A point that has at least 5 observations will have an area of 5 while a value that is observed at least 10 will have a corresponding area. 

```{r}
?geom_count
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("With jitter")
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
 geom_count() +
  ggtitle("With count")
```


#### *4. What's the default position for adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.*

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
